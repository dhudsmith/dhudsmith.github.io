Thanks for visiting! üëã

I am a machine learning scientist at Clemson University. I wear several hats:

* üé© Director of Applied Machine Learning -- [Division of Research Computing and Data](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/), Clemson University
* üéì Research Associate Professor -- [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/), Clemson University
* ‚õëÔ∏è Co-Lead -- [Clemson/MUSC Artificial Intelligence Hub](https://web.musc.edu/innovation/ai-hub)

My current research focuses on sample-efficient deep learning techniques for healthcare applications. Better sample efficiency means that you need less data, lowering costs and opening the door to new applications. To improve efficiency, I find ways to build inductive priors into the model architecture or training procedure. This requires deep thinking about each problem followed by concrete algorithmic expression of any insights. See [my publications](/publications) for more.

I have a PhD in theoretical atomic Physics from Ohio State university. Though I don't consider myself to be a Physicist anymore, I strive to bring the conceptual dynamism, mathematical rigor, and unmatched style of The Physicist to my work in machine learning. My latent Physicist also asserts himself through [my artwork](/artwork).
