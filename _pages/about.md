I am a machine learning scientist at Clemson University. 

Currently, I am researching sample-efficient 
deep learning techniques for scientific applications in medicine and social science. 
Working closely with clinicians and other domain experts, I build inductive priors into model architectures and 
training procedures. These priors offset the need for large, labeled datasets, enabling deep learning applications
in data-constrained settings. See [my publications](/pubs)

I have a PhD in theoretical atomic Physics from Ohio State university. Though I don't consider myself to be a Physicist anymore, I strive to bring the conceptual dynamism, mathematical rigor, and unmatched style of The Physicist to my work in machine learning. My latent Physicist also asserts himself through [my visualizations](/viz).
